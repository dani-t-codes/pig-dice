      <h2>About the Game</h2>

      <p>Pig Dice is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it. In Pig Dice, you'll roll dice each round, adding up the total number from all dice rolled. That is, unless a 1 is rolled, at which point your turn score becomes 0 and you pass your turn to your opponent. It begins as a game of chance, but quickly turns into a game of strategy as you compete with yourself and your opponent over the risks vs the rewards.</p>
  
      <p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>

      <h4>How to Play</h4>

      <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>

      <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins!</p>
